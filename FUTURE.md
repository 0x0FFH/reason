## 1.13.8?

- Even better infix operators formatting for `==`, `&&` and the rest (#1380)

## 3.0.0

- Remove unused binaries: `reup`, etc.
- Remove `--add-printers` from `refmt`. The feature wasn't stable enough; we'll find a better way soon. Sorry about that!
- New syntax based on (but not entirely) #1299
